Thank you for stopping by, my name is Jack. I am many things:

* Music nut
* Snowboarder
* Car enthusiast
* Photographer
* Investor
* Most of all I am a big nerd

I like all things technical but also the stranger things. Mostly I am just someone who enjoys witting code. It's what I 
do for a job and [igu.io](http://igu.io) is my way of geeking out.

I work in central **London** as a software developer and love every moment of it
